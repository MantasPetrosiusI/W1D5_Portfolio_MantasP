            <p><h3>Hello! My name is Mantas and I was born in Lithuania, however currently I live in Ireland.
                Ever since I was a kid I had a passion about everything computer related, be it software or hardware, 
                which you will see in my "Education" part. <p class="funfact">Fun fact about my name is that while nothing different about my first name my last name has different spelling in Lithuania which is "Petrošius", I use different spelling in Ireland as they do not have letter "š/Š" here.</p>
            </h3></p>

                <div><p id="PJZG">There's not much to talk about, this is where I spent my teenage years and learned basic stuff like math, biology, geography etc. However this is also the place where i was first introduced to programming.</p></div>

                <div><p id="DIFE">DIFE was my first school in Ireland, I had to take this course because my grades from Lithuania didn't fit their grading system here. The course focused on "Games Development" and it lasted for 1 year, it gaves us basics like 3D modeling, storyboarding, and even hand-drawn animation! After year ended I was sure I wanted to develop games, but things don't go as planned.</p></div>

                <div><p id="DKIT">And those plans brought me here as when registering "Games Development" and "Computer Science" had one number difference (you had to enter their respective codes to apply for the course) and by mistake, I applied for the latter and... got in! I spent two years in DKIT learning Java, some Web Development, Hardware, etc... And after the second year, ironically I failed the Web Development exam by a small margin, which would have made me repeat the whole year by only doing that module. PS It would have been 3 hours each week.</p></div>

                <div><p id="EPICODE">And this is where that led me, focusing on developing websites! Being completely honest I learned here more in a week than there in 2 years... Anyway I left a lot of space for EPICODE as I am only starting so who knows what will happen.</p></div>
