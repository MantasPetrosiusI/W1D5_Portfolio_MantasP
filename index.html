            <p><h3>Hello! My name is Mantas and I was born in Lithuania, however currently I live in Ireland.
                Ever since I was a kid I had a passion about everything computer related, be it software or hardware, 
                which you will see in my "Education" part. <p class="funfact">Fun fact about my name is that while nothing different about my first name my last name has different spelling in Lithuania which is "Petrošius", I use different spelling in Ireland as they do not have letter "š/Š" here.</p>
